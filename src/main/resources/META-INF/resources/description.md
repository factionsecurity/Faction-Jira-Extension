This Extension enables JIRA integration. When the assessment is finalized all vulnerabilities will be sent to JIRA and FACTION will be updated with the JIRA Tracking number.  

To use this extension you must:
1. Get your JIRA API key. Log into JIRA then go to [Profile->Manage Account->Security->API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
2. Enter your JIRA API Key and JIRA Hostname into the FACTION App Dashboard.
3. Create a Custom Field to Allow Users to change the location of the JIRA Dashboard.
